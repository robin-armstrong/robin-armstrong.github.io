I am a PhD candidate at Cornell University's [Center for Applied Mathematics](https://www.cam.cornell.edu/cam), supervised by professor [Anil Damle](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~damle/). I work on the design and analysis of numerical methods for data-driven modeling of high-dimensional Earth systems, most often using tools from matrix analysis and numerical linear algebra.

My research develops mathematical theory and numerical methods that combine data-driven and physics-driven modeling approaches, either by using data to improve a physics-driven model (e.g., data assimilation), or by using _a priori_ physical knowledge to regularize a data-driven model (e.g., structured covariance matrix estimation). Because many Earth systems are extremely high-dimensional, computational efficiency is a central concern in my work. In this vein, much of my research has focused on designing and analyzing efficient computational primitives in randomized numerical linear algebra and low-rank approximation.
