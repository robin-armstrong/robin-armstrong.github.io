I am a PhD candidate at Cornell University's [Center for Applied Mathematics](https://www.cam.cornell.edu/cam), supervised by professor [Anil Damle](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~damle/). I work on the design and analysis of numerical methods for data-driven modeling of high-dimensional Earth systems, most often using tools from matrix analysis and numerical linear algebra.

My research develops mathematical theory and numerical methods for synthesizing data-driven and physics-driven approaches to Earth systems modeling. This encompasses methods which use data to improve the forecasts of a physics-driven model (i.e., data assimilation), methods which use _a priori_ physical knowledge to regularize a data-driven model (e.g., structured covariance matrix estimation), and methods for building data-driven models that are physically interpretable (e.g., model order reduction). Because many Earth systems are extremely high-dimensional, computational efficiency is a central concern in my work. In this vein, much of my research has focused on designing and analyzing efficient computational primitives in randomized numerical linear algebra and low-rank approximation.
